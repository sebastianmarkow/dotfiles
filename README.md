# ðŸ’¥ðŸ”« dotdotdotdotdotfiles

A heavily opinionated set of dotfiles (git, vim, fish & tmux).

## Requirements

* `make`
* `bash`

## Usage

    $ git clone https://github.com/sebastianmarkow/dotfiles.git
    $ cd dotfiles
    $ make help

**Warning:** `make install` and `make all` targets will overwrite existing
dotfiles in the `$HOME` directory of the current user. Be sure to backup any
files you'd like to keep.

# ðŸ’¥ðŸ”« dotdotdotdotdotfiles

A heavily opinionated set of dotfiles (git, vim, fish & tmux).

## Requirements

* `make`
* `bash`

## Usage

    $ git clone https://github.com/sebastianmarkow/dotfiles.git

**Warning:** `install` and `all` target will overwrite existing dotfiles in the
`$HOME` directory of the current user. Be sure to backup any files you'd like to
keep.

> **Dotfile's Creed**  
> These are my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these ones are mine. My
> dotfiles are my best friends. They are my life. I must master them as I must
> master my life. Without me, my dotfiles are useless. Without my dotfiles, I am
> useless. I must hack my dotfiles true. I must hack slyer than my enemy who is
> trying to out-kaggle me. I must push my commits before another pushes its. I
> willâ€¦  
> My dotfiles and I know that what counts in industry are not the stickers on
> our laptops, the noise of our marketing, nor the buzzwords we make up. We know
> that it is the solution that counts. We will solveâ€¦  
> My dotfiles are human, even as I, because they are my life. Thus, I will study
> them like a core dump. I will learn their weaknesses, their strength, their
> parts, their accessories, their formats and their documentation. I will keep
> my dotfiles clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready. We will become part
> of each other. We willâ€¦  
> Before FM-2030, I swear this creed. My dotfiles and I are the defenders of the
> future. We are the masters of our enemy. We are the saviors of my life. So be
> it, until artificial intelligence is here and there is no enemy, but peace!
